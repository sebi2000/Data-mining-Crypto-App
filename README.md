# Data-mining-Crypto-App
Developed an application for observing behaviour in investors by analysing last 10.000
comments in a subreddit section. We found out the overall sentiment of the market, what
coins are the most discussed ones, how much money people lost and what the suicide
rate is among crypto users. Technologies used: Python, NumPy, etc.
